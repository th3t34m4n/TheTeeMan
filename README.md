# About Me
# ☕ TheTeeMan | Cybersecurity Learner | Teacher | Powered by Ataaya

Hi there! I’m **Aslam**, also known online as **TheTeeMan** — a name inspired by my love for *Ataaya*, the strong green tea that's a lifeline for many in West Africa. It keeps me awake, sharp, and energized through late-night study sessions and early morning teaching prep.

I'm a passionate **cybersecurity learner** and **basic school teacher** from a rural community in Northern Ghana. My tech journey was born out of adversity and a mission — to protect others from digital threats like the one that hit my own family.
